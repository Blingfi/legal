We strongly encourage all parents and guardians to monitor the Internet use by their children. If you use the Service, you affirm you are at least 18 years old.

By creating an Account with BLING, You agree to the following rules to protect the security of Your Account:

1. You shall not share Bling Account login details (included login details of your Facebook or Google account), nor let anyone else access Your Bling Account (including your Facebook or Google account to the extent those are linked with your Bling Account) or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of Your Bling Account (or your Facebook or Google account to the extent those are linked to your Bling Account). BLING will not ask You to reveal Your Facebook, Google, or e-mail password and will not initiate contact with You asking for answers to Your Facebook or Google password security questions;
2. In the event You become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including, without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Your Bling Account, Facebook account, or Google account, or any email/password combination used by your Bling Account. You will immediately notify BLING and modify Your Facebook or Google login, to the extent they are linked to your Bling Account;
3. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Bling Account;
4. You are responsible for anything that happens on your Bling Account, whether or not such actions were taken by You. You therefore acknowledge that BLING may suspend Your access to or terminate Your use of the Service if someone else uses it to engage in any activity that violates these Terms;
5. You undertake to monitor Your Bling Account to restrict use by minors, and You will deny access to anyone under the age of 18.

Any personal information You provide to us, which may include Your name, birth date and email address, will be held and used in accordance with BLING' Privacy Policy, which is herein incorporated by reference. You agree that You will supply accurate and complete information to us, and that You will update that information promptly after it changes.



### License

To use the Service You must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Application.  BLING does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with your mobile device.  If you decide to use the Service, subject to Your agreement and compliance with these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and applicable terms and conditions of our partners. BLING hereby grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use an object code copy of the Application for one registered account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by You. You may only play on one device at a time. You may not have multiple accounts, even if you have multiple devices. BLING also grants You a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited scope license to access and use those portions of the Service that are not part of the Application.  Use of the Service shall be solely for Your own, private, non-commercial entertainment purposes and for no other purpose whatsoever. BLING can terminate this license at any time and with or without any reason. If the Service or any part thereof is determined to be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction in which You are situated, You shall not be granted any license to use the Application or any other part of the Service, and must refrain from using it.  You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Application; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Application to any third party or use the Application to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Application; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Application, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Application; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Application.  You acknowledge that BLING may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Application, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Application that You are using on Your mobile device, but that BLING has no obligation to do so.  You consent to such automatic upgrading on Your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to all such upgrades.  The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Application or any copy thereof, and BLING and its third party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Application (and any copy of the Application).  Standard carrier data charges may apply to Your use of the Application.



### Virtual Items

Your use of the Bling Applications may allow you to Virtual Items ("Virtual Items") such as Game Tickets, Raffle Tickets, and Bling Points, in various ways. You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of bitcoin or its equivalent. Rather, by "earning" Virtual Items, You are granted a limited license to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Virtual Items. In the event BLING encounters issues with the game that impact the accumulation of Virtual Items, BLING reserves the right to correct any such errors. BLING prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated outside of the Service, or the purported sale, gift or trade of anything that appears or originates in the Service, unless otherwise expressly authorized by BLING in writing. Accordingly, You may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game, without BLING' written permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject Your Account to termination.

 You acknowledge and agree that BLING shall have no liability for loss of Virtual Items due to any unauthorized third party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining, social engineering, and/or any other unauthorized third party activity. BLING owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears on or in the Service, including all such content owned by our Rewards Partners and their affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, You agree that You have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without limitation the Virtual Items therein, whether "earned" in a game or "purchased" from BLING.



### Accumulating Bling Points

You may accumulate points on our platform ("Bling Points") by taking certain actions while using the Services. Bling Points have no monetary value.

**For Android users:**  Bling Points are platform-wide loyalty points earned by taking certain actions, such as by playing games or "liking" certain aspects of the Service. The foregoing list is solely for purposes of example and explanation and is not meant to be exclusive or exhaustive. Bling Points are NOT and WILL NOT be awarded or earned in any way related to or based upon the outcome of any game You play during Your use of the Services.

**For iOS users:**  Bling Points are platform-wide rewards earned for certain outcomes, such as registering a Bling account or winning a game against an opponent.



### Redeeming Bling Points

If you elect to redeem Bling Points in your Bling Account for cryptocurrency, upon request through specific means and subject to minimum amounts and limitations set out in the Service, such cryptocurrency may be paid out to you by Bling (or a third party payment processor on our behalf). Upon submitting your request for payment, Bling may, in its sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, reject, cancel or terminate such request or payment, as applicable. If your request for payment is approved by Bling, information will be sent to our third party payment processor and such payment will be processed on behalf of Bling using their service. Currently, Bling requires you to use Coinbase to receive the cryptocurrency, and will not honor requests for redemption through any other means. You do not need to have a Coinbase account upon redemption, but will be required to create and validate a Coinbase account to claim your cryptocurrency within 30 days of the redemption request or as required by Coinbase. Coinbase will ask you for certain identification information for compliance reasons during the account creation process. Once we process a redemption request and send the cryptocurrency to the email address You provided, we will deduct the applicable number of Bling Points from your account. Redemption requests are irreversible. You are responsible for setting up your Coinbase account and keeping the account in good status to claim the cryptocurrency. Bling makes a best effort to process redemption requests, but does not ensure that such requests will be honored. To the extent our payment processor rejects the transaction, we will attempt to process the transaction for a few more days. If the payment processor continues to reject the transfer, we will discontinue redemption attempts and will expire your Bling points.

 BLING is not responsible for reporting or paying any applicable taxes or processing fees in respect of any Bling Points you redeem for cryptocurrency. You are responsible for and agree to promptly pay, all charges, including applicable taxes and processing fees in respect of any Bling points you redeem for cryptocurrency. Personal information that you submit during the payment process is subject to our Privacy Statement. You may only send one redemption request every seven (7) days.

 You agree and accept responsibility for keeping all your BLING Account information current, including email address and Coinbase payout address. Bling reserves the right to change the number of Bling Points awarded, conversion rates, fees and charges associated with the Service at any time and from time to time without any notice to you or any other person or any liability. Bling Points have no cash or monetary value and are non-transferable. You may not sell, trade, barter, bequeath or in any way transfer any Reward to any other party. Any attempt to do so will invalidate the Reward and may result in the termination of Your Account.



### Inactive Accounts
If You do not use your Account by playing a game on a Bling Application to completion at least once every 30 days, Your Account will be deemed inactive. You can, at any time, reactivate Your Account by playing a game on a Bling Application to completion. When an Account has been deemed inactive, BLING may, at its own discretion, expire any Virtual Items, Bling Points, Game Tickets, or Raffle Tickets accumulated by You. Once Your account is deemed inactive, any Rewards which have been purchased but not yet redeemed may also be expired at the discretion of BLING. YOU AGREE THAT BLING AND ITS PARTNERS AND AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR, AND SHALL BE HELD HARMLESS BY YOU AGAINST ANY LIABILITY FOR INJURIES, LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND TO PERSONS (INCLUDING YOURSELF) OR PROPERTY RESULTING IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM YOUR INACTIVITY ON THE SERVICE OR ACCEPTANCE, POSSESSION, MISUSE OR USE OF ANY PAYMENTS FROM BLING.



### Third Party Providers of Goods and Services

Occasionally, we partner with third parties ("Reward Partners") to provide additional opportunities for You to earn Virtual Items. Rewards Partners reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to change, amend, suspend, cancel, or terminate any reward program they offer or any aspects and/or terms and conditions thereof, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice and for any or no reason.  Any such changes may affect Your ability to earn certain Virtual Items that You have accumulated through Your use of the Service. You hereby agree that BLING shall have no liability to You as a result of such action any Rewards Partner.



### Termination

BLING may terminate or suspend Your Account (including, but not limited to, suspending your ability to earn and redeem Virtual Items) and/or Your access to Service (including, but not limited to, restricting your ability to use the Applications) at any time, including for breach of these Terms, registering with temporary or disposable email services, registering with invalid emails, registering with private domains, using VPNs, playing a game on multiple devices simultaneously, or otherwise, without notice. Upon any such termination, Your access to the Service, including all User Content (as defined below) and Virtual Items, will be disabled and You will lose any Bling Points that you have accumulated. You may cancel Your Account at any time by discontinuing Your use of the Service and/or the Applications. BLING is in no way liable to You for the effects of any termination or cancellation on Your use of the Service or the Virtual Items You have accumulated.

 Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.

 Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.

 If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.
